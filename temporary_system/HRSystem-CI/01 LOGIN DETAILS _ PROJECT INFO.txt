ERROR! For anyone else that comes across this error, I also experienced it after upgrading to PHP 8.1. The only way I could find to "fix" it was by adding #[\ReturnTypeWillChange] before the open, read, write, close, destroy and gc functions in /system/libraries/Session/drivers/Session_files_driver.php. For example:

#[\ReturnTypeWillChange]
public function open($save_path, $name)
{
